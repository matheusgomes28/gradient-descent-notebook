# Gradient Descent Notebook For Linear Regression
Repository for storing the notebook for gradient descent in the context of linear regression. For
more information about the theory and the implementation, check out my website's post on
[implementing gradient descent for linear regression with Python](https://matgomes.com/gradient-descent-for-linear-regression-in-python/).
